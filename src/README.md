This module really simplifies the creation and use of databases.
But sacrifices eficciency for simplicity.

It's thinked for begginers or for projects where speed isn't vital. 

### Installation

To install the package, run the following command:
```js
npm i simplest.db --save
```

if you don't want to use the SQLite/simple.SQLite databases, you should do 

```js
npm i simplest.db --no-optional
```

!!!
